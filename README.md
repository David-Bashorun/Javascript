Javascript is the functionality of your web or mobile application

Java script variables
variables (var ,let ,const)
These variables can be used interchangeably. But some are required in certain situations
Let and Var operate have similar functions
while const. (constant) is only used when an value is constant
data types(number,string,boolean,arrays,objects , undefined, null)
number are numerical values they can be written as they are without quotation marks
string are alphanumerical values such as letters and symbols e.g David , Fish. 
String are placed in between quotation marks "David"
boolean data type refers to a value that is either true or false 
arrays are a set of values from any of the datatypes they begin with "[" and end with "]" with the values separated by commas
objects like arrays refers to a set of values but an object differs in the way it is written and its uses. For example values in an object normally include the field of the value and its value itself e.g Age:9 Animal: Fish. They begin with "{" and end with "}"
undefined refers to data that hasn't been declared as any datatype
null refers to a zero value

javascript is used to increase the functionality using all of these features stated above. It makes use of anchors which are normally named according to their uses the anchors are yellow in color.
